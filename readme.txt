Add price-drop auctions to any post type in WordPress, with automatic price reduction until a purchase is made.

== Description ==

Add price-drop auctions to your website! This plugin allows you to assign auctions to any post type or custom post type (CPT) in WordPress. Set a starting price, a minimum price, and the start and end dates of the auction directly in each post. During the auction, the price will automatically decrease over time until a buyer makes a purchase or the minimum price is reached by the auction's end date. Perfect for creating an exciting and unique buying experience!
